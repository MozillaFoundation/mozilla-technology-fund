# 2023: Auditing Tools for AI Systems

## Funding focus

In 2022, Mozilla welcomed our [inaugural Mozilla Technology Fund cohort](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/introducing-the-first-ever-mozilla-technology-fund-cohort/), which focused on reducing the bias in and increasing the transparency of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Building on our learnings from that cohort, we’ve decided to focus our resources in 2023 on an emerging area of tooling that is under-resourced and where we see a real opportunity for impact: open source auditing tools. While AI systems are increasingly being used to make determinations that impact people’s employment, health, finances and legal status, there are few mechanisms in place to ensure that these systems are being held accountable for harms, bias and discrimination. [In 2023, the Mozilla Technology Fund will fund and convene eight projects](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/auditing-ai-announcing-the-2023-mozilla-technology-fund-cohort/) which will grow, support, and better coordinate the community of AI auditors through tooling and resources.
